# CPP_Final_Project
This project was the final for CSC 239 Advanced C++ at Guilford Technical Community College.

This project is a program for buying theater seat tickets.  It uses two .dat files to run the program.  The SeatAvailability.dat file is the seating diagram and it uses # to represent open seats and * for reserved seats.  The SeatPrice.dat file holds the prices for each row in the theatre.  The user chooses the amount of seats needed, then chooses the row, they are given a price, and you simulate giving the cashier money, then the program saves the seats as reserved.
